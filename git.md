Git is version control. If you have 5 different job positions to apply for, how many files would you have? Probably 5. That's inefficient!
> with git, you can have 1 file under version control

To start version controlling your project: git init
> This creates a folder called .git - To undo version control, rm -rf .git

To download somebody's repository, do `git clone ____` (this could be their directory if on the same computer, or their url)

add, commit, branch, checkout -b branchName

Concepts:
* branch
